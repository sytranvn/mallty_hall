![](Monty_open_door.svg)

Suppose you're on a game show, and you're given the choice of three doors:
Behind one door is a car; behind the others, goats. You pick a door, say No. 1,
and the host, who knows what's behind the doors, opens another door, say No. 3,
which has a goat. He then says to you, "Do you want to pick door No. 2?" Is it
to your advantage to switch your choice?


If you think switching to door No.2 doesn't matter, I was on your team  ðŸ¤¯.
